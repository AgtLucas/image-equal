# image-equal

Assert that two images are similar. This is useful for testing applications
with visual output, like those that work with node-canvas or WebGL. Due
to platform differences, images generated by these applications are often
slightly different in terms of anti-aliasing or other details, but are
'close enough' that you want to accept the result.

## install

    npm install --save-dev image-equal

## use

```js
t.ifError(imageEqual(result, expectation));
```
